# Civilisational HTTP Error Codes

To be truly useful, HTTP error codes need to take into account possible future issues.

We therefore propose the 8xx range of codes for errors pertaining to the civilisation
in which the server is operating.

Inspired by https://github.com/joho/7XX-rfc. Forks and pull requests encouraged!
